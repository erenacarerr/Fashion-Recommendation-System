We took the model, which was in a sample project, into our project to try it out. To briefly summarize the model, there are two separate inputs at the entrance, one for the trousers and the other for the t-shirt. There is a hidden layer in between and there is a score on the layer where the outputs of both branches meet. howeverAt this stage of the project, we encountered a problem that we have not yet solved. In short, our problem is that the dimensions of the photographs do not match the model we created. Even though we reshaped the photos that did this with the resize command, it did not work and we remained at this stage of the project."
