    "    One of the requested projects for the machine learning course was to design a program that creates a fashion recommendation system. The starting point of the project was that we thought about how we could use fashion and artificial intelligence together, and we started researching to create a program that makes combinations according to the person. To start the project, we first needed a database. After finding a suitable data set with clothing photos, all we have to do is decide how to score combination suggestions. We searched for suitable training systems to train our data. As a result of our research, we decided to use the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method for image processing."
